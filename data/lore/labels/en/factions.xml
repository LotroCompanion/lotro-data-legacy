<label key="key:620792408:54354734" value="The Elves of Rivendell hold council over the Wise in the lands of Eriador. If there is any power that might hold fast against Angmar and its dark magics, it is here.&#10;&#10;Nonetheless, recent incursions into the Trollshaws by evil Men and Goblins have set the elves on edge as they quietly prepare for their last war."/>
<label key="key:620792409:54354734" value="The Men of Bree have stood as a bastion of commerce and stubborn strength in the north since nearly the beginning of the Third Age.&#10;&#10;Since the fall of Arnor, they have kept a wary eye upon the cursed Barrow-downs, prepared to face the dark evil that slumbers there, waiting to awaken at its master's heed."/>

<label key="key:620792414:54354734" value="The Hobbits of the Shire enjoy many fine leisure activities when they are not so busy eating or growing food.  One such activity is the collection of Mathoms, items that hobbits have no particular use for but hold onto anyway.&#10;&#10;The Mathom Society are a group of hobbits dedicated to the collection of such items, and they scour the countryside in search of new items to add to their collection, when they aren’t busy planning a mathom society dinner that is!"/>
