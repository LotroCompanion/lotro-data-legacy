<label key="key:620759184:118018273" value="A section of the introduction, this page suggests that the author was neither modest nor the type to shy from a fight. She was apparently overly fond of causing trouble at inns throughout Eriador, sometimes going so far as to cheat openly at dice in order to provoke a fight."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018274" value="This page describes some of the author's favourite knives. It seems that she had an Elf-smith make blades for her as custom pieces which she particularly preferred for their speed and edge. She must have treated them rather roughly, given the sheer number of knives she describes in loving detail."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018275" value="The author appears to have preferred combat with an unusual level of intensity compared to what one might expect of a burglar. The style she describes emphasises a degree of closure and commitment to finishing a fight quickly rather than the furtive hit-and-run tactics that one commonly associates with the profession."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018276" value="It is clear from the context of this page that the author preferred to work alone, without companions. This perhaps explains her dedication to the art of in-fighting and an emphasis on finishing fights up close and as quickly as possible. She likely had few friends or companions to fall back on in times of danger."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018277" value="This page is difficult to follow as it is covered with sketchy diagrams as well as scrawled text.

<label key="key:620759184:118018278" value="This page does not seem to have much to do with knife fighting.&#10;&#10;The author seems to have wandered into a rambling recollection of one of her more hair-raising exploits, the details of which are both quite bawdy, and rather too dramatic and unlikely to be an entirely honest account...."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018279" value="A page of painstakingly inked lines and diagrams. It must be describing a particular set of motions.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the notes in the margins of the page are impossible to make out, leaving you to do a great deal of guesswork as to what motions this complex web of lines might actually be trying to depict."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018280" value="This page is a recap of much of what has been described before, but it is surprisingly concise and clear compared to most of what came before, drawing a number of important lines between the stylistic points that she has made previously. Either the author recieved some editorial assistance with this section, or perhaps she was just sober during its writing.&#10;&#10;In any case, it is an invaluable guide to sorting out the mismatched notes throughout the rest of the book."/>

Nevertheless, she was acknowledged as one of the finest knife-fighters in Middle-Earth during her time.&#10;&#10;The Book of Knives is sadly incomplete, and little can be learned from its cryptic writings.

<label key="key:620759198:118018274" value="As you read more, there is no question that Knee-breaker was little more than a ruffian and a brigand, selling his services to the highest bidder with little regard to the unsavoury nature of the jobs he undertook.&#10;&#10;The trouble is that he was apparently very, very good at what he did, due to some trick of instinct that guided him unerringly to exploit the weaknesses of those he fought against."/>

It cannot really be called anything else -- a band of individuals who followed him almost entirely out of fear, which he encouraged, having little use for real friendship.&#10;&#10;Knee-breaker himself seems to have rarely taken the risk of fighting alone, preferring instead to set up his victims for a thorough beating at the hands of his subordinates. The idea of a fair fight was probably as foreign to him as bathing."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018276" value="As you decipher the script upon this page, it becomes clear that the true purpose of this manual was an effort by the unknown author to translate Knee-breaker's instincts for brutality and cunning into a more intellectual form that could be learned or taught -- and then used to the author's own benefit.&#10;&#10;Surprisingly, this author seems to have made considerable headway in learning the true nature of Knee-breaker's cunning, and the notes contained herein do seem to be hinting towards some important knowledge."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018277" value="This page describes a particular revelation of the writer in his observation of Knee-breaker -- namely the degree to which he relied on sudden and brutal surprise, not just to throw his enemy off-balance, but more importantly to create a crystal-clear moment upon which even the most dull-witted of his underlings could seize to jump upon and overwhelm the enemy before their own cowardice and doubt hamper the assault."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018278" value="According to this passage, Knee-breaker would often as not neglect to even follow up upon his own surprising assaults, preferring to leave most of the battle to his underlings so that he could keep the situation entirely under his supervision and not be drawn into a melee unecessarily.&#10;&#10;This apparently made it even more difficult for one of his untrustworthy followers to turn upon him at a crucial moment and gave him the opportunity to land the showy finishing blow should he feel a need to display his own prowess to his followers."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018279" value="The tone of this page has changed considerably. At this point, the book no longer appears to be relating observations of Knee-breaker's own techniques and exploits, so much as it has become a dissertation of the author's own understanding of the brute's methods.&#10;&#10;The text becomes more difficult to follow as it wanders into more abstract elements of the technique, but it also begins to make it much clearer how one might actually duplicate Knee-breaker's feats without the benefit of his raw brutality and animal cunning."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018280" value="The last page of the manual appears to be a description of Knee-breaker's untimely demise and a fond farewell passage in his honour.&#10;&#10;The author's underlying tone of irony belies little love lost for his dead master, and though the text does not make it clear, the hints between the lines suggest quite strongly that the author was most likely the main architect of his betrayal and demise, apparently having learned all he cared to from the unfortunate brute."/>

<label key="key:620759209:118018273" value="This page outlines a bit of the subject's background -- one Adelbert Took, a close relative of the legendary Bandobras 'Bullroarer' Took. He was apparently something of a trouble-maker without much appreciation of other people's property rights as a young lad, and as such found himself in more than his share of bouts.&#10;&#10;The text suggests that this is where the foundation was laid for his eventual accomplishments later in life."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018274" value="This page describes the sequence of events that led to Adelbert being pressed into service in the Shire-muster.&#10;&#10;It seems that Bandobras Took had become so exasperated with his nephew's behaviour that he personally arranged for the lad to be sent off to the fighting. The text provides a quote from Bullroarer to the effect that the experience would either 'Make him a better Hobbit or kill the young fool off, and either way the rest of us'll be better for it!'"/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018275" value="This page sums up a sequence of letters sent home by Adelbert during the course of his duty in the strife with Golfimbul. To the surprise of all, the lad seemed to have taken to the course of battles and war like a fish to water -- as much as any hobbit could, at any rate. However, he seemed dismissive of the regimentation and orderly nature of the Muster, referring to them as a band of 'useless fops and dandies what hadn't a notion which end of a pike they ought to be on'.&#10;&#10;It seems that he then went about forming his own little band of ruffians and skirmishers from among those hobbits of the more aggressive sort that he could convince to join him -- an act of insubordination that surely would have seen him in irons if they had not quickly proven themselves to be among the most proficient scouts and ambushers in the entire force."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018276" value="This page recounts the experiences of one of Adelbert's fellow hobbits, wherein he goes into the tactics of traps and ambush that they frequently employed against their goblin adversaries, often striking at the break of day as the goblins would be attempting to find shadowy refuge against the painful light of dawn.&#10;&#10;Often they would find the entrance to a cave near a battlefield and wait there concealed, knowing it would be likely that the goblins would attempt to return there as light came back upon the land."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018277" value="This page is particularly interesting as it describes the terrible difficulties the diminutive band of hobbit-skirmishers would face when they came upon particularly deadly foes, such as goblin champions during their battles.&#10;&#10;It seems that Adelbert himself was the foremost among them in finding the weaknesses of such dangerous adversaries, with a keen understanding of the need to expose them so that his fellows could employ their numbers to overwhelm."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018278" value="This page relates some of Adelbert's personal quotes and observations from the field of battle. Of particular note is the degree to which the foes he often faced relied upon intimidation.&#10;&#10;He then describes the advantage he often found that he gained when he was able to deal a painful blow against such an enemy -- even if the injury itself was of little consequence, the opponent often became confused as it seemed that the tables had turned in the favour of its opponent, thus providing the opening Adelbert and his fellows needed to fell the creature."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018279" value="This page describes Adelbert's fighting style as he taught it to his companions during the campaign. It emphasizes a quick and savage assault, often aimed at the strongest leader or beast among the enemy forces in a bid to both eliminate the most dangerous threat and demoralize the enemy at a single stroke.&#10;&#10;The most telling drawback of the method is that the battle will quickly turn against the small assailants if a powerful enemy manages to withstand the attack for more than a few moments, so it entails considerable risk and a readiness to flee swiftly if things do not go their way."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018280" value="This final page speaks of the Battle of Greenfields wherein Brandobras Took himself struck off the head of Golfimbul in a single blow. It seems that Adelbert was also involved in this battle, fighting some ways distant from his uncle during the fray and aqcuitting himself admirably. Adelbert was sorely injured in the battle and was some months recovering in the comfort of the Shire afterwards.&#10;&#10;Alas, it seems that all the trials faced and lessons learned did surprisingly little to cure the notable character flaws of the miscreant, but he nevertheless became one of Brandobras' favourites in the years that followed and was generally put up with as an errant but likable fellow."/>

<label key="key:620759209:54354734" value="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting was written about a rather notorious hobbit-burglar early in the Third Age, when the Shire was not so secure as it is today. Having found himself drafted into the Shire-muster during a particularly difficult season and pitted against Golfimbul's goblins in a number of pitched battles, he learned to fight in a most ungentlehobbitly fashion that served him well against foes considerably larger and stronger than himself.&#10;&#10;Alas, it has been many years since its writing, and all copies of this interesting text were thought lost, until now.

<label key="key:620759230:118018273" value="This page heads a basic taxonomy of many of the more common beasts and birds of Middle-earth, offering a short entry describing their names, forms, and where they might be found. The author must be incredibly well-travelled or else has conversed with those who have brought much knowledge from abroad, for the regions he describes extend far beyond the borders of the Kingdoms of the West, into foreign lands with strange and alien names -- and equally odd beasts."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018274" value="This section is dedicated to a discussion of the songs of the smallest of birds and their meanings. The concepts the author describes are not nearly as flighty as one might imagine given the beautiful and transient nature of their songs.&#10;&#10;It would appear that even songbirds must discuss matters of serious import -- at least on occasion."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018275" value="This page describes the diet of bears, which seems to vary considerably from one species to the next. Most it seems would eat the sweet berries and roots to be found in many areas of Middle-earth, while only some will eat meat, and only a few prefer it. He describes the ferocity of bears mainly as a result of their territorial instincts, particularly when mothering cubs and further suggests that this is a power that can be tapped by one who has learned to understand them sufficiently well."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018276" value="This page involves a lengthy discussion of seeds: what plants produce seeds that are edible and which species of animals rely upon them. It offers nothing to help unravel the mystery of why the scribe who copied the original pages might have distorted them so badly."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018277" value="This page again delves into bears...after a fashion.&#10;&#10;It describes a unique tribe of the animals -- unique at first in that they can be called a tribe, which is not common among bears, and secondly because the author proposes that these creatures can in fact take upon themselves the shape of Men should they find the need to do so!&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the author seems prepared to guard the secret of this tribe rather jealously, offering no hints as to where these 'bear-men' might be found."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018278" value="This page discusses the nature of the crebain, a particularly devious form of crow, depending on how you choose to classify them.&#10;&#10;These birds are widely known to have a predeliction for mischief, but the author feels that it goes considerably deeper than that, suggesting that long ago their kind were offered a pact by some dark power in return for an intellect and cunning that extends well beyond that common among animals -- a pact which they accepted and that has bound them through ages since in thrall to that power."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018279" value="This passage seems particularly interesting. Within it, the author discusses spiders at some length. He draws a stark comparison between the common spiders that you might find within your garden or basement, and those breeds that grow to dreadful sizes and display a hateful cunning and hunger.&#10;&#10;While most folk presume that these deadly creatures are simply greater forms of the more common spiders, the mysterious author suggests that these two branches of spider-kind are entirely unrelated. Indeed, he seems to suggest that all of the forms of giant spiders can in fact describe their lineage from a single horrifying monster who existed in long ages past, and that it is from her that their intelligence as well as their grotesque size are descended."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018280" value="Sitting towards the end of the book, this page delves into the power of a mysterious tribe of bear-men, noting that their power suggests a maleability of form that derives from the nature of the spirit -- even amongst Men.&#10;&#10;The author surmises that perhaps some nature of those who formed the world is present in some tribes of Men, and that this may be what grants them such powers that others lack? Or perhaps that nature is present in all Men, and only some few have learned the secret of it?&#10;&#10;The other then rambles on a bit and supposes that the most likely answer is that they are really bears after all, and perhaps bears of a particularly foolish sort if they have chosen to take on the forms of Men. How odd."/>

<label key="key:620759230:54354734" value="It is unclear who wrote this book as no author's name is given, but the clarity and wisdom with which it is written only adds further to the mystery of its apparently modest writer. The Book of Beasts speaks at great length of the bonds which may be formed between creatures of the wilds and those among the Free Peoples of Middle-earth who are willing to understand their own true natures. It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.&#10;&#10;Whomever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind. Most of the text is clear, but some few of the pages are written in a hopeless scrawl with no meaning in any language of Elves or Men that you can discern.

<label key="key:620759241:118018273" value="This page begins a list of plants that may be found in the forests of northern Middle-earth, including every sub-species and variety.&#10;&#10;It appears to go on for at least another ten pages -- in very, very small print -- and you are sure you have not even heard of half of them.&#10;&#10;You find yourself wondering how many years it must have taken to compile that list."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018274" value="This page begins a long, rambling dissertation on the shape of leaves. It describes all the varieties of leaf, including colours, shapes, stems, and vein patterns.&#10;&#10;By the end of the tract, you begin to realize that the author has tied them all back together in a most interesting fashion."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018275" value="The author spends a great deal of time discussing the methods by which plants procreate, from seed and nut, to root and creeper. You had not realized before just how many variations there really were.&#10;&#10;There is even a section dedicated to a particular type of tree that only spreads itself after death, as young new trees sprout up along the length of the old tree's fallen, rotting trunk."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018276" value="This section speaks of the proper ways to nourish and tend young plants.&#10;&#10;It reads quite unlike a common book on farming, however, as it is concerned more with the development of wild fields and forests and has little to say about harvesting or sowing in the traditional sense.&#10;&#10;The author does not seem to consider the development of crops as a meaningful pursuit, so much as the creation of a vibrant, living glade or meadow."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018277" value="This section delves into the lore of roots and their interaction with the earth,  discussing their purpose and growth and the effect they have upon rock and soil.&#10;&#10;Most interestingly, it discusses the method by which small hardy bushes and trees cling to harsh, bare rock, slowly breaking it apart year after long year, until in time greater trees and lush undergrowth may take its place amongst the shattered rock and reach into the earth below.&#10;&#10;The process must take centuries -- even the immortal Elves have not the patience to watch such things -- yet the author writes as if he has seen these events first-hand."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018278" value="This section goes on at great length concerning the matter of water and its importance to all living things.&#10;&#10;It notes how many species of tree and plant grow upon the edge of running water and in time come to shape its course to their own needs and purposes, much as a farmer might irrigate a field."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018279" value="This page speaks of the long battles fought amongst plants, as they struggle to live like any other thing.&#10;&#10;The author speaks of these conflicts almost as if they were fought amongst regiments and armies of Men, yet it is clear that these 'wars' are fought out over endless years, and the struggle itself is unguided by any General or King save the forces of nature themselves -- excepting of course when the younger races come wielding axe and fire and upset this order, and events come to move more swiftly.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the author seems to nonchalantly include even the Elves and dwarves amongst the 'younger races' as a matter of course...."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018280" value="This last section lacks an index of any sort, much as the beginning had no chapters -- as if such an idea simply had not occured to the author, and he expected anyone hefting this massive tome to simply read it through from end to end, even if all they sought was the name of a particular flower.&#10;&#10;As a reference, this book is nearly useless despite its encyclopedic volume, but you are forced to admit that you have never encountered such a vast and comprehensive book concerning the true nature and qualities of plants."/>

<label key="key:620759241:54354734" value="This is a strange book indeed. The covers are crafted from strips of some fibrous bark supple enough to be woven together, while the pages themselves appear to be birch bark pounded carefully flat and gently inscribed with runic letters in dense rows, page after page. What magic can have allowed such a fragile-looking tome to survive time and age, you cannot guess. Nor have you ever seen a book of such length, for its author goes into each subject and sentence with such painstaking detail that you cannot imagine how long it must have taken to record it all in this fashion. The subject appears to be anything with roots and leaves. There is such an enormous breadth of knowledge concerning root, leaf, bark, and twig that you could likely study it for years without understanding it all.&#10;&#10;To your ire, someone or something has carefully removed a few of the pages from the volume, leaving you to wonder what hidden lore they must have contained.

<label key="key:620759438:118018274" value="This page leads a section of the book describing the early phases of the war, before the Alliance of Elves and Men was fully founded and suspicion was yet rife between the two sides, even as the true threat of Mordor began to reveal itself. This regiment had long been posted in the north to guard the river Anduin as it entered the realm of Gondor -- it is there that the contrivances of the Enemy brought them into unexpected battle with an expedition of Elven warriors come far south out of Lórien."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018275" value="This page describes the contrivance of the Enemy that triggered the ill-fated battle between the forces of Gondor and Lórien. At that time, the forces of Gondor had in their employ men of wild nature whom they paid to bring them news from lands beyond their border, such as the Eastern Marches of Rohan and the Wilderlands.&#10;&#10;They had in part forgotten that they must always be wary of the Enemy's ability to corrupt the hearts of Men, for these untrustworthy scouts brought tidings of a foreign force that had come down the river from the North, armed and armoured in the ways of war and unannounced by any herald -- for those heralds had been slain by dark shadows that crept in the night, unbeknownst to either army."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018276" value="The battle began on a mist-enshrouded morning, as the valiant men of Gondor fell upon the vanguard of the 'invading' host, sowing confusion and panic among the unsuspecting Elves. But the regiment was doubly betrayed, for the quisling servants of the Enemy had lied as well about the size of the Elvish force that had come from the North, and as the main body of their army crested a nearby hill, the Men of Gondor were greatly dismayed, for it was thrice the size they had been told and near equal in number to their own force."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018277" value="Thinking that the worst of fates had come to pass -- that the Elves had somehow thrown in their lot with the forces of the Enemy and so brought the moment of utter defeat and ruin fast upon them -- the Men of Gondor dared not shrink from their foes in the midst of battle, lest all hope of victory be lost in a moment of hesitation.&#10;&#10;Their Captains rallied the men amongst the remnants of the shattered Elf-vanguard and bade them prepare to charge against the Elves, hoping to rout them from the field of battle with the ferocity of their momentum, knowing that prowess and armour would ensure the victory of their immortal foes should the tide of battle turn for even a moment."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018278" value="The page follows a florid description of the great blaze of trumpets and the snapping of banners in the rapidly clearing morning, as the sun rose higher upon the field, and the regiment sprang into thunderous motion up the hill.&#10;&#10;The captain then describes his own puzzlement as he watched the archers of the Elf-host begin their response, hurling their arrows not at them, but up into the sky, the motion of each archer seeming almost lazy and indifferent to the onrushing army, but each one moving with a strict and rapid precision that belied their careless aim."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018279" value="This page describes a bedlam of frightened men and horses as arrows rained down among them, a seemingly endless hail of shafts biting armour, flesh, and ground alike with callous indifference. The captain relates that it was not the deadly accuracy of the arrows that inspired fear and chaos, but their random intensity, such that no man upon the field might feel safe or protected for even a moment whether he carried shield or stood in the shadow of his fellow, and so many faltered and stopped, laying about in vain for cover where there was none to be found.&#10;&#10;The indifferent rain continued until all was chaos and disorder, and few were those valiant souls who made their way to the Elf-host, there to die upon sword and pike wielded with ruthless efficiency."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018280" value="The captain's last entry describes matters that followed the battle, after the Elves took him and those few others who survived their injuries upon the field captive, and in a short while untangled the deception of the Enemy, for it had been his purpose that the battle should not be so decisive, or that the Men of the West should emerge victorious over the forces of Lórien and so unravel the nascent Alliance -- but the Elves, having come to little harm in the battle, were thus inclined to be lenient and instead directed their anger even more hotly towards Barad-dûr.&#10;&#10;The captain closes by pondering the irony of his regiment's defeat. Had they acquitted themselves with greater valour and cunning upon the field of battle that day...what then would have befallen the Kingdom of Gondor, or indeed all of Middle-earth in the war that followed? Small comfort for so many friends lost, but such are the whims of fate and war."/>

<label key="key:620759438:54354734" value="The Furthest Charge was written by a Captain of Gondor who fought in a misguided battle shortly before the War of the Last Alliance. In this battle, the forces of the young kingdom of Gondor found themselves pitted against a company of Elven hunters out of Lórien, both sides having been tricked into battle by a device of the Enemy, who was determined to cripple the alliance that would eventually result in his overthrow. In this book, the Captain describes a valiant but doomed charge of the Men of Gondor against the Elves, within which they suffered a terrible onslaught of arrows raining down from the sky in such fashion as to cause brave men to cower and falter in their advance, trapped unmoving beneath an endless hail of biting wood and metal.&#10;&#10;The Furthest Charge is considered to be a defining work on the power of the hunter's art in the grand battles that have defined the face of Middle-earth today. Unfortunately, this copy is badly damaged by time and wear. Perhaps Legolas of Mirkwood, purported to be in Eriador, could shed some light upon the text."/>

<label key="key:620759615:118018273" value="Like many of the songs in Melodies of the Valar, this one is wordless, guiding the voice of the performer as an insturment.&#10;&#10;The song itself seems to conjure in the mind of the listener the image of a babbling brook beneath the foothills of some distant and long-forgotten mountain."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018274" value="The lyrics of the song upon this page are in some strange language even the Elves do not recognize. While in some respects it sounds similar to Sindarin, it is nevertheless alien.&#10;&#10;When listening to the words a sense of unmeasurable ages settles upon you, as if the singer were attempting to describe a time before even the Elves set foot upon the lands of Middle-earth."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018275" value="This song is meant to be sung in a chorus of voices, starting with one and each entering the chorus in turn.&#10;&#10;It is said that when it is performed correctly beneath the light of the stars, the sound rises ever upwards drawing the listeners with it into a rapt contemplation of the vastness of the star-strewn sky."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018276" value="This quiet piece evokes a sense of suspended tension in the air, much as one might feel in the rumbling forerunners of a summer storm flickering upon the horizon.&#10;&#10;How a simple human voice could convey such feelings is unclear, but the effect is unmistakably powerful."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018277" value="This page presents a slow and sonorous melody. It is hard to imagine how a woman's fair voice could have created such a deep tone.&#10;&#10;Its words are mysterious and no known language describes them, but the listener may find themselves transported into an ancient realm beneath the earth, seemingly accompanied  by the tread of heavy boots upon stone and the glimmer of vast caverns formed of lime and crystal, seen as if for the first time by any living eyes. In time, the chant reaches its end and the listener finds himself awakening as if from a deep slumber."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018278" value="This song wells with deep sadness, speaking of honour long fallen to pride and a people lost in dreams of forgotten glory. The music meanders along a bittersweet path that seems to lead inevitably towards the swelling roar of the ocean, along a mythic shore lost beneath the endless waves ages ago."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018279" value="This song is strikingly different from all those that come before. It speaks to the listener of valour, strength, and the achievements of great craft. Clear and certain tones strike a chord deep within any who would lead or who strive to achieve.&#10;&#10;Yet from this lofty beginning it continues without abatement, speaking of the authority of Kings and of the unquenchable pride of one who must master all they attempt. The tones become uncomfortably assertive, assailing the listener, seeming to place a weight upon their shoulders, pushing ever more firmly downwards.&#10;&#10;The final chord reaches a victorious peak as the voice of the singer booms out over the audience with unquestionable authority, demanding submission and adulation from all who listen. It is a powerful, stirring piece, yet some of those who hear it also find it to be profoundly disturbing."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018280" value="This last piece is most unusual. It is sung in a single voice that conjures forth the image of an infinitely patient crafter building a castle out of tiny pebbles upon the beach, that time and again is dashed away by angry tides. Yet with each passing of the tide the structure grows, becoming ever more grand over ages of quiet labour.&#10;&#10;In the end, the song describes an ancient and beautiful fortress, weathered with the passage of tide and time, inhabited by an elegant, noble people and bearing the banners of a hundred honourable houses upon its walls, standing impregnable upon the edge of an ocean whose tides still crash below -- still violent, but humbled by the crafter's patient art.&#10;&#10;Given that the song offers no words to be understood by mortal (or Elven) ears, it seems odd that such concepts might be conveyed, and yet it does so with remarkable clarity."/>

<label key="key:620759615:54354734" value="It is said in the most ancient of tales that the world was formed in a great chorus of song, but this story is ancient and shrouded in myth even to the oldest among the living Elves, and no one in Middle-earth today could claim to know the truth of it. Towards the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance, there was born a fair human woman who sang in such wonderous tones that even the Elves would stop and listen in silence for so long as she would sing for them. Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.&#10;&#10;Melodies of the Valar is the book that contains these songs as the Elves transcribed them, but most of the copies of this book have been taken away into the West, and very few remain in Middle-earth today. Alas, this one has been damaged, but an Elven minstrel of renown might well be able to shed some light on the matter."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018273" value="This page details a classical Dúnedain song from the times when Arnor still stood proudly in the North, extoling the strength and vigour of that lost kingdom.&#10;&#10;Given the rather maudlin praises of the distant past that they seem to prefer in this day and age, the song offers a striking example of how a people's music may change over the passage of years to reflect the condition and times within which they live. It also hints at the strength and heights to which they might again aspire...."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018274" value="Recorded in a particularly ancient form of Sindarin, this song purports to be an Elvish work in praise of the light of Elbereth's stars, written in a timeless age before the Sun and the Moon hung in the sky.&#10;&#10;It is a remarkably simple song, containing few of the more complex contrivances of form that can often be found in Elvish music. Even so, the story of the song's origin sounds more like some tale out of myth than you are ready to give credence to."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018275" value="This spry piece seems to hail from the Shire. It purports to be a local harvest-song from around the Michel Delving area, sung by many of the farmers and youths there as they move through the fields in late summer and fall. The lyrics speak of the fine meals they would enjoy in their comfortable holes during the long, cold winter months that follow."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018276" value="This song was written by a talented singer amongst the Rohirrim and speaks simply and clearly of the love he held for a young woman among his own people.&#10;&#10;Unlike so many love-songs, it does not dwell on the sorrow of parting, nor unrequitted love, nor jealousy, nor hardship of any sort. It speaks solely of her beauty in his eyes, and the joy that comes to those lovers who learn to truly understand each other."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018277" value="Technically speaking, this song is a dwarf-dirge sung for the fallen upon the field of battle, though it is not clear which of the dwarf-houses it hails from.&#10;&#10;The song's relationship to a dirge is distant at best, as it turns the sombre tones of the form on their head with the inclusion of bawdy, irreverent lyrics intended to unreservedly celebrate both the life and death of the fallen hero. Indeed, you have never seen so brash and overt a challenge to the sullen and infinite power of death as this song proposes."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018278" value="This song is a victory march from Gondor, written to celebrate the grand victory of the Last Alliance over the forces of darkness and the fall of Sauron. It was written before Isildur's untimely death, and in the context of the events that followed, it has gained an undertone of sombre irony.&#10;&#10;Regardless, it also clearly declares the strength and power of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth to rise up against seemingly unconquerable adversity."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018279" value="Though sometimes it seems that the immortal span of the Elves results in a preponderance of art that breathtakingly mourns times and places lost beyond the memory of any mortal race, there are also those that speak of the vitality of the endless present, describing the experience of those Elves who do not care to dwell on the events of ages past.&#10;&#10;This song is one of the latter, rooted firmly in the experience of living in a vital world that obligingly continues to change, offering an unlimited pallette of new experiences to anyone who cares to open their eyes to the world that surrounds them in the here and now."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018280" value="This song speaks only to the wonder and pallette of the natural world, without acknowledgement of axe, nor fire, but only the passage of seasons, the growth of trees, and the wandering of animals who guard no purpose beyond the day at hand.&#10;&#10;At first, you suppose that it might be an Elvish song, but on further reflection the forms do not reflect that heritage of music. In fact, you find it difficult to determine who might have written such a piece, for it does not adhere to the principles common to any of the Free Peoples -- and it is certainly no work of Orc or Dragon -- but the mystery only adds to its cachet as a unique and vibrant work of art."/>

<label key="key:620759628:54354734" value="The Rising Chord is considered to be a remarkable collection of songs all of a theme that speaks to the heart of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in one voice, be they Men, Elves, or dwarves. Drawing on the tradition of each of these peoples, the songs resound with a clarion call of freedom and hope that is unsullied by the slightest trace of sorrow, fear, or hate. There are some who claim that this work is shallow and without dimension, but to the adept minstrel, it is a description of form unparalleled by other works. Unfortunately, the book and its strident forms became 'unfashionable' after the fall of the North Kingdom, as a deep lethargy and cynicism crept over the kingdoms of Men, and the Elves withdrew ever further into their forest strongholds.&#10;&#10;'Nowadays, The Rising Chord is quite difficult to find, and even when a copy is found -- such as this -- it is incomplete at best. Perhaps the famed Elvish minstrel Lindir might be able to tell you more about it."/>

<label key="key:620759641:118018273" value="The first song is an old Númenórean rower's song meant to lift the spirits of soldiers bent hard at the oar and to prevent fatigue before impending battle at sea. It called upon the winds to offer speed, the morning mists to confound their enemies, and the waves to hurl them ashore lest they founder in the deeps."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018274" value="This ancient music was a ceremonial march played for soldiers who had returned from across the sea, to celebrate their safe homecoming after duties far from the shores of the Isle of Númenor."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018275" value="This stirring but mournful march was supposedly played to commemorate the deaths of lesser nobles and dignitaries of the ancient kingdom of Númenor."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018276" value="This unique piece was supposedly played in the royal court of Númenor to unmistakably announce the victory of the King whenever a conquered leader was brought before his throne. It was played in that court for the last time when the Enemy was brought before the King in chains, having surrendered before the might of Númenor's armies.&#10;&#10;After the fall of Númenor it came to be said that to play this march was to invite disaster and defeat in any military endeavour."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018277" value="This drum-dominated score is a truly classical example of a military march. Played by the soldiers of Númenor as they marched victoriously across the ancient lands of Middle-earth, it was one of the most recognizable pieces of music in its day.&#10;&#10;Many variataions of this score exist today, but the original was thought lost in the long turmoil following the sudden fall of that mighty kingdom."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018278" value="This drum score is considered very unusual for the period of the Númenóreans. Minstrels and scholars suppose that its writer may have been influenced by contact with the musical culture of the Haradrim, far off in the uncharted South of Middle-earth.&#10;&#10;Such was the scope and power of Númenor at its height that even those distant kingdoms knew war and trade with the Men of Westernesse."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018279" value="Though penned by a minstrel of Númenor, this song is written in Sindarin and shows numerous influences from the Elven culture of music.&#10;&#10;This piece likely arose during the earlier span of Númenor's long reign before the Men of Westernesse mostly turned away from their appreciation of things Elvish, and a deep estrangement formed between the their peoples."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018280" value="This song was an anthem written to celebrate the unlimited might and majesty of the Last King of Númenor as he embarked at the head of a vast expeditionary fleet. It speaks of a vast fleet numbering in the thousands and of the ascension of the King to godhood as he proudly sailed into the West.&#10;&#10;The song ends half-finished -- clearly the minstrel had left it incomplete in expectation of describing the victorious return of the fleet with its god-king, but never got the chance to do so."/>

Though its cover crumbles with age, the binding remains strong, as if infused with the same martial fervour that the melodies within it strive to invoke. This book is one of the rare few that survived the fall of the kingdom of Númenor, coming across the waves by some unlikely circumstance to Middle-earth, where it has lain hidden for ages. Though written in the Sindarin tongue, the songs are those of the noble kingdoms of Men. Nevertheless, they speak to the heart of any who would face battle, calling forth visions of endless, shining hosts on the march, thundering with the clash of steel in a thousand voices.&#10;&#10;In the hands of a minstrel, these songs of martial eminence provide crucial insight into the working of the warrior's heart and how it might be aroused from its slumber in times of need. If only so many of the songs were not frustratingly missing from the volume you now hold. Perhaps Lindir of Rivendell may be able to help fill the voids."/>

<label key="key:620759777:118018273" value="This page includes a scholarly discussion of the gravity of oaths and debates the merits of granting them to personages of differing relationships and ranks.&#10;&#10;It particularly stresses the danger inherent in a personage of high station granting an oath to someone of lesser station, for it ties not only the oathgiver by their word, but all of their vassals and subjects as well to the fate of the one to whom that oath is granted -- for good or for ill."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018274" value="This section of the book includes a spirited argument between philosophers over the nature of Oaths and the Fate of those who become bound up in them.&#10;&#10;On one side of the matter are those who argue that the words and intent of the Oathgiver serve to shape fate itself, tying them irrovocably together in a bond that may guide the actions of those who are part of it in their endeavours -- and similarly hanging as a sword over the Oathgiver, promising a dread fate should that bond be violated.&#10;&#10;The other side of the debate includes scholars who reject the notion that mere words shape the world, claiming instead that it is the actions of the Oathgiver that decide the outcome of fate. They argue that the Oath itself simply acts to focus the will or prove the lie of the one who takes it, and that the shame of failure, corruption of the spirit, and the disillusionment of their peers serve more than adequately to turn the tides of fate against the oathbreaker without need of divine providence to mete out punishment."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018275" value="This page leads into a discussion at considerable depth of the fate of an ancient Elf who was a Lord among Lords, who set upon himself and his people an Oath so powerful and dire that it is believed to have shaped the course of entire ages of the world, and the fate of countless Elves, Men, and Dwarves.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the argument remains quite abstract within these pages, as the scholars of Men who penned the work seem only to know of these events through legends and myths, and the Elves of that time were apparently not keen to discuss the subject openly.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, if the events described by the scholars are indeed founded even partially in truth, it suggests that the Oath taken by this Elf-lord may well have been the most powerful words ever to pass the lips of any being of Middle-earth, be they mortal or immortal, wizard or king."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018276" value="This page wanders into a highly esoteric discussion concerning Oaths and Dragons.&#10;&#10;True Dragons are renowned for their power to subtly twist words to their own ends and befuddle the minds of those who are foolish enough to treat with them. The writer attempts to determine whether a creature such as a Dragon could ever truly be bound by an Oath, however granted, or whether they could indeed be bound as such, but would instead use their mastery of lies and deceit to craft an Oath such that the one to whom they granted it would find themselves bound instead.&#10;&#10;The arguments, while interesting, eventually become circular and insubstantial as it becomes clear that the writer had little experience in the subject of speaking with Dragons, yet was wise enough not to seek out experiemental evidence with which to support his work...."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018277" value="This page discusses the care with which even the lightest of Oaths must be given. It states that while all Oaths bind, the strength of that bond and the fate that follows may have little to do with the gravity of the words spoken, and a great deal to do with the unforeseen events that then follow.&#10;&#10;In particular, the scholar points out the story of a simple and friendly Oath offered at the birthday of a minor noble of the houses of Númenor -- an Oath that in the course of time and events drew his house into a years-long war which served to destroy the fortunes of his family and saw him die a lonely pauper.&#10;&#10;Alas, it is impossible to say if the tale was a true one, or a cautionary fable devised by the author to strengthen his argument."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018278" value="Many tales speak of the dire consequence of an Oath foolishly given or broken. This page offers a discussion of the strength that may be gained through such bonds when they are wisely taken and followed.&#10;&#10;It speaks of a terribly old legend that describes a Man and an Elf-maiden bound in an Oath of love that was so true and so powerful that though in time they found themselves trapped beneath the gaze of the greatest Enemy of that or any other Age, they nonetheless found the means to escape that Evil and flee back into the light of the Sun, stealing away his greatest treasure with them."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018279" value="This page describes in detail the Oath of the King of Númenor, taken upon his ascendancy to office. The section goes on into enormous detail concerning how the Oath changed over the course of long dynasties and all the various legal and ceremonial ramifictaions of those changes.&#10;&#10;Despite the wealth of historical knowledge, you find that after reading a few of the minutely printed paragraphs your head begins to ache with the convoluted wording and excessively complex detail, and you fear that you might either nod off, be driven mad, or both should you continue."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018280" value="This page stands out from among the rest. The ink it is written in is a strange, messy scrawl, and it delves into a disturbing subject indeed, quite different from the rest of the book.&#10;&#10;The writer of this particular section seems obsessed with those spirits which remain in the world of the living long after the time of their own death, and the possible cause of this strange and disturbing undeath.&#10;&#10;In some cases at least, such spirits are known to have claimed some unresolved or broken Oath as the bond that holds them in this world beyond their time, and the writer delves into the subject with unbridled curiosity, pondering on what power might make the bond of a man's Oath so strong as to keep it in the world long beyond its time.&#10;&#10;Further passages become more disturbing yet, as it becomes clear that the writer's facination with the subject has become unhealthy, as he ponders how servants and slaves might perhaps be made to take Oaths that would bind them in service to their Lords after death.&#10;&#10;If the author of this piece ever discovered such a secret, you find with some relief that it is not recorded here."/>

<label key="key:620764901:118018279" value="This page is the first to discuss technique beyond the most basic of motions.

<label key="key:620765205:54354734" value="This book was written as a primer in the Guardian's art some time in the middle of the Third Age, during the difficult period after the fall of Khazad-dûm. At that time, Durin's Folk were scattered and greatly reduced in number, and the Guardian's role took on a much greater importance as the threat of goblins and Orcs to dwarf-settlements beneath the roots of the world became more and more common. The dwarves often settled for building powerful strongholds designed to make the approach to their cities, impervious to assault, manning them with skilled and powerful guardians to ensure that none would pass unchallenged.&#10;&#10;While the book itself is common enough, the owner of this copy seems to have scribbled copious notes within the margins of the pages -- notes containing an experience and insight to the art that even at a glance exceeds that of the original author. Unfortunately, the copy is worn and tattered, and a number of pages are missing. Perhaps someone well-versed in the art could provide you with some insight as to the identity of the mysterious scribbler and where his remaining notes could be found?"/>

<label key="key:620765217:54354734" value="A Shield-maiden's Song was written many long years ago and tells the tale of a Shield-maiden of Rohan. While the Shield-maidens of Rohan were rarely called to war, they were nevertheless as well-trained and versed in the arts of battle as their male counterparts. This book tells the tale of one such Maiden caught in unexpected battle, who in striving to defend her Lord against a great onslaught, sang out in clearest tones a stirring song of war as she fought. Such was the power of her voice that even the Orcs whom she faced saw her not as a frail woman, but as a great warrior to be feared.&#10;&#10;Alas, you have no idea how the story ends and several other details beside seem to be missing from this copy of the book, which has been damaged by time and neglect. Perhaps there is someone at Rivendell who would be able to make use of it."/>

<label key="key:620765229:118018273" value="Like several others, this section is written mainly in Elven prose of an ancient form, making it devilishly difficult to comprehend. You manage to make out several passages that refer to the Oaths of service or fealty that the Elf-guardians of old would make to their charges and lords before embarking into danger.&#10;&#10;It seems that they believed such Oaths formed the an important foundation for their strength in battle, and they would never enter into them lightly."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018274" value="Another page of nearly indecipherable and ancient prose, it describes battle between two enemies as something other than a simple melee.&#10;&#10;Instead, the text describes battles between powerful foes as a form of ritual or dance (your translation here is uncertain) -- one that forms the basis for a bond between the two combatants that transcends the physical.&#10;&#10;You begin to suspect that the author was a of a decidedly mystical outlook."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018275" value="Sticking to indescipherable prose, the author speaks of the greater tide of battle, wherein many foes stand across from each other hurling insult and threat before inevitably breaking upon each other. This aspect, too, he considers the foundation of a greater bond, both between the fellow warriors of each army, and between the two forces themselves as they steel themselves for battle.&#10;&#10;You remain unclear on the nature of this bond the author keeps referring to, but it is clearly the central theme of the work."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018276" value="This page is one of the few written in plain language, though the ancient tongue makes it difficult nevertheless.&#10;&#10;It speaks of more mundane subjects than some of the others, such as the crucial role of the guardian in maintaining control over the pace of battle, never allowing it to run away from from them and become that portrait of meaningless chaos and noise that presages defeat."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018277" value="Another of the few pages that forego prose for plain language, this speaks to the strength of the guardian's defence, and the manner in which it permits them to find their way to the pulsing heart of the battle, a vantage from which one may express the greatest degree of control over the ebb and flow of the enemy's motion and morale."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018278" value="This page is written in prose so flowery and intricate that after the toils of translating the ancient text you are left with no idea what point the author was trying to make.&#10;&#10;Hopefully it is not crucial to the book's secrets or the author would have spoken more plainly?"/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018279" value="This poem describes that moment in which a great warrior finds himself standing at the heart of the maelstrom -- that place in time and space where the course of the battle almost seems to be suspended like a great thunderhead, moments before the storm breaks. A sense of dread fate falls upon the warrior's shoulders, knowing that the next decision made will resonate with the fate of the world and describe much that is to come."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018280" value="The final page tells of a word -- or perhaps a will made manifest by the heart of the warrior as they stand among their foes and allies alike. Both Oath and Challenge, the form of the word itself is second to its purpose and moment, which the warrior may use to bind all those who face him to his own fate irrevocably.&#10;&#10;The author's point is clear. You find yourself wondering whether he purposes to say that there is truly a spiritual force to this word, or whether it is simply a call to the burning hatred of your enemies that in such a time and place they cannot refuse it."/>

<label key="key:620765229:54354734" value="This book is of Elvish origin, having been written so long ago that few of the Elves today were alive at the time of its writing. You cannot even guess at how old it actually is, as it seems to show few signs of age or decay. You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.&#10;&#10;It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past.

<label key="key:620767446:54354734" value="Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair.

<label key="key:620774283:118018275" value="The cairn is rather unlike many that the Men of old built, but you recalled a tale of an old battle...&#10;&#10;In the time after the fall of Arnor and the defeat of Angmar by the host of Gondor, few men remained in the north. Those who remained loyal to the old kings banded together under the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain and became the forebears of the Rangers who walk these lands today, or so it is rumoured.&#10;&#10;In those days there were still evil Men and worse who walked these lands and there was a battle few Men alive today remember. Though the Dúnedain were victorious, their numbers dwindled. The cairn you have found is most likely the resting place of the men who died in that battle, built hurriedly and in secret."/>
<label key="key:620774283:118018276" value="You found a carving with an old Arnorian symbol upon it. It appeared to be the crest of the ancient kingdom of Arthedain.&#10;&#10;The ruins of that kingdom stretch for miles to the south-west and north. Bree-town itself was built upon a crossroads between Arthedain and its sister kingdom Cardolan to the east. Once they were all one great kingdom, stretching all across the north, but the folly of Men first sundered them, then set them against each other until one after another they fell over the long years of the Third Age.&#10;&#10;There are some folk who still remember the tales of Arthedain, but you suspect that the crest may be of particular importance to the Rangers, for it is said that they are descended from that bloodline."/>
<label key="key:620774283:118018277" value="The strange altar you found appeared to be Arnorian in origin, with signs that some gathering or ritual had taken place there recently.&#10;&#10;You've heard rumours that Rangers here in the north occasionally gather for a ceremony to declare the coming of age of one of their number, where they induct the young man or woman into their ranks by way of an oath to the old kingdoms."/>

So the folk tales say, anyway."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018275" value="The flower you found marks the place where the Entwife Dorollin passed into the Old Forest, perhaps forever.&#10;&#10;She was among the largest of her kind, taller than any other, for the essence of all that grows was at the core of her nature. Her gardens were sprawling places wrapped in great vines, and enormous trees cast their shade upon acres of fertile ground.&#10;&#10;She gave herself to the Old Forest to ensure that it would grow great enough to protect itself from the incursion of evil such as Orcs and thoughtless Men.&#10;&#10;Some folk say that one day they will awaken and emerge from the forest - but no one knows when that might be."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018276" value="You discovered Cordofoneth's flower - said to be one of eight Entwife sisters.

The flower you have found marks the place where she entered the the forest, and she has not been seen since.&#10;&#10;Alas, the Old Forest has oft been harmed by Men or intruded upon by darker powers, and so it is said that her heart lies muted, and she sleeps more deeply than her sisters. Perhaps she is awaiting the day when this world might become a place of lighter moods and the love of life is not so easily betrayed by axe or fire."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018277" value="You have discoverd the flower of Lenhwest. She was believed to be an Entwife known for her unquenchable passions. She could love as no other, but fury and despair were also her constant companions.&#10;&#10;Amongst her sisters, she was the first to give herself to the forest, swept by her own emotions to ensure its survival during the trials of those dark years. Her presense is strongly felt in these woods still.&#10;&#10;It is for fear of Lenhwest's tempestuous anger that folk walk with care in the Old Forest, for many believe that if her heart turns against you, it is unlikely you will ever emerge from it again!"/>

<label key="key:620774284:118018279" value="The flower of Braiglad is seen as a warning by superstitious folk who would dare the depths of the Old Forest. She was an Entwife unusual amongst her sisters, for she was a wild and capricious being. Her gardens were populated by untamed beasts, and even the most delicate flowers within them were adorned with sharp thorns.&#10;&#10;Braiglad rarely spoke with mortals, preferring the wild places of the forest, and in time she gave herself to the forest to protect it from the dark powers.&#10;&#10;There are those who say her spirit is strongest when aroused by wild and dangerous times such as these."/>

Of the eight Entwives who came to the Old Forest, she was the most beautiful and the most beloved of all.&#10;&#10;Her gardens shone with a brilliance of colour that even the finest artisans of the Firstborn would regard with envy. Her jewels were said to be the petals of flowers, and while they would last but a short season -- unlike the gems of the Noldor which are forever -- their beauty far surpassed that of any object carved of stone or crystal. This passing beauty was such that it endured no greed, and so the vanity of evil hearts could neither possess nor endure it.&#10;&#10;Those who are fond of the story say that she will awaken some day when beauty can again be shared amongst all the creatures of Arda without fear of despoilment or jealous vanity."/>

Their numbers have also dwindled in Middle-earth -- but recently many of the lesser drakes have been unleashed from Angmar, which is worrisome indeed, for if these lesser beasts have reappeared, can the Dragons be far behind?

Once Ost Forod rose to pre-eminence in the north Barad Rath declined in importance and is believed to have been used as an occasional retreat for members of the Royal Family who could not find sufficent peace and isolation in the bustling courts of Annúminas or their estate at Tinnudir."/>
<label key="key:620791301:118018279" value="Given the evidence of the beautiful and extensive structures once built on the island of Rantost, it is strangely devoid of mention in the histories of Arnor. It is possible that some powerful family seeking a more reclusive and quiet lifestyle far from the continual chaos of the capital chose to construct their estate here - but if so that same reclusive nature has erased any mention of them from the tales and histories of the Northern Kingdom, and they are lost to time forever."/>
<label key="key:620791301:118018280" value="Isolated by the lake from most of the other estates and ruins of Evendim, few scholars are certain of the nature of the ruins that lie there today. The foremost theories suggest that it may have once been either a prison or vault used by the rulers of Annúminas - this at least would explain the general secrecy and rare mention of the place in histories of the region.&#10;&#10;Alas, there is little solid evidence to support these ideas, save for a series of unusually deep and extensive cellars within the crumbling ruins. If there were vaults here, they have long ago been picked over for any valuables they might have contained."/>

However, any traveller hoping to take shelter within would be strongly advised to look elsewhere, for this same warmth has drawn a large and deadly brood of worms into these caves, and to carelessly wander within is certain death."/>

In time, tired of being tormented by their diminutive foes, the giants left this place and moved towards Iorbar to the south-west.&#10;&#10;Only the massive stone slabs that they once used as shelter remain, echoing with the howls of the Wargs who now prowl among them."/>
