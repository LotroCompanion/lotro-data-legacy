Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair. The author also proves to be a bit difficult to pin down, as he has chosen to identify himself solely by the runic letter 'G' inscribed on the binding.">

It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.&#10;&#10;Whomever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind. Most of the text is clear, but some few of the pages are written in a hopeless scrawl with no meaning in any language of Elves or Men that you can discern.

He draws a stark comparison between the common spiders that you might find within your garden or basement, and those breeds that grow to dreadful sizes and display a hateful cunning and hunger.&#10;&#10;While most folk presume that these deadly creatures are simply greater forms of the more common spiders, the mysterious author suggests that these two branches of spider-kind are entirely unrelated. Indeed, he seems to suggest that all of the forms of giant spiders can in fact describe their lineage from a single horrifying monster who existed in long ages past, and that it is from her that their intelligence as well as their grotesque size are descended." progressOverride="The Book of Beasts, page 33" itemId="1879052184" itemName="The Book of Beasts, Page 33"/>

Or perhaps that nature is present in all Men, and only some few have learned the secret of it?&#10;&#10;The other then rambles on a bit and supposes that the most likely answer is that they are really bears after all, and perhaps bears of a particularly foolish sort if they have chosen to take on the forms of Men.

Nor have you ever seen a book of such length, for its author goes into each subject and sentence with such painstaking detail that you cannot imagine how long it must have taken to record it all in this fashion. The subject appears to be anything with roots and leaves. There is such an enormous breadth of knowledge concerning root, leaf, bark, and twig that you could likely study it for years without understanding it all.&#10;&#10;To your ire, someone or something has carefully removed a few of the pages from the volume, leaving you to wonder what hidden lore they must have contained.

Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise.

In fact, you find it difficult to determine who might have written such a piece, for it does not adhere to the principles common to any of the Free Peoples -- and it is certainly no work of Orc or Dragon -- but the mystery only adds to its cachet as a unique and vibrant work of art." progressOverride="The Rising Chord, page 28" itemId="1879052893" itemName="The Rising Chord, Page 28"/>

Though its cover crumbles with age, the binding remains strong, as if infused with the same martial fervour that the melodies within it strive to invoke. This book is one of the rare few that survived the fall of the kingdom of Númenor, coming across the waves by some unlikely circumstance to Middle-earth, where it has lain hidden for ages. Though written in the Sindarin tongue, the songs are those of the noble kingdoms of Men. Nevertheless, they speak to the heart of any who would face battle, calling forth visions of endless, shining hosts on the march, thundering with the clash of steel in a thousand voices.&#10;&#10;In the hands of a minstrel, these songs of martial eminence provide crucial insight into the working of the warrior's heart and how it might be aroused from its slumber in times of need.

<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="According to this passage, Knee-breaker would often as not neglect to even follow up upon his own surprising assaults, preferring to leave most of the battle to his underlings so that he could keep the situation entirely under his supervision and not be drawn into a melee unecessarily.&#10;&#10;This apparently made it even more difficult for one of his untrustworthy followers to turn upon him at a crucial moment and gave him the opportunity to land the showy finishing blow should he feel a need to display his own prowess to his followers." progressOverride="Knee-breaker's Manual, page 15" itemId="1879052144" itemName="Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 15"/>

However, he seemed dismissive of the regimentation and orderly nature of the Muster, referring to them as a band of 'useless fops and dandies what hadn't a notion which end of a pike they ought to be on'.&#10;&#10;It seems that he then went about forming his own little band of ruffians and skirmishers from among those hobbits of the more aggressive sort that he could convince to join him -- an act of insubordination that surely would have seen him in irons if they had not quickly proven themselves to be among the most proficient scouts and ambushers in the entire force." progressOverride="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, page 7" itemId="1879052153" itemName="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 7"/>

<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This page describes Adelbert's fighting style as he taught it to his companions during the campaign. It emphasizes a quick and savage assault, often aimed at the strongest leader or beast among the enemy forces in a bid to both eliminate the most dangerous threat and demoralize the enemy at a single stroke.&#10;&#10;The most telling drawback of the method is that the battle will quickly turn against the small assailants if a powerful enemy manages to withstand the attack for more than a few moments, so it entails considerable risk and a readiness to flee swiftly if things do not go their way." progressOverride="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, page 24" itemId="1879052157" itemName="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 24"/>

This regiment had long been posted in the north to guard the river Anduin as it entered the realm of Gondor -- it is there that the contrivances of the Enemy brought them into unexpected battle with an expedition of Elven warriors come far south out of Lórien." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 9" itemId="1879052524" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 9"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This page describes the contrivance of the Enemy that triggered the ill-fated battle between the forces of Gondor and Lórien. At that time, the forces of Gondor had in their employ men of wild nature whom they paid to bring them news from lands beyond their border, such as the Eastern Marches of Rohan and the Wilderlands.&#10;&#10;They had in part forgotten that they must always be wary of the Enemy's ability to corrupt the hearts of Men, for these untrustworthy scouts brought tidings of a foreign force that had come down the river from the North, armed and armoured in the ways of war and unannounced by any herald -- for those heralds had been slain by dark shadows that crept in the night, unbeknownst to either army." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 10" itemId="1879052525" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 10"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="The battle began on a mist-enshrouded morning, as the valiant men of Gondor fell upon the vanguard of the 'invading' host, sowing confusion and panic among the unsuspecting Elves. But the regiment was doubly betrayed, for the quisling servants of the Enemy had lied as well about the size of the Elvish force that had come from the North, and as the main body of their army crested a nearby hill, the Men of Gondor were greatly dismayed, for it was thrice the size they had been told and near equal in number to their own force." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 14" itemId="1879052526" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 14"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="Thinking that the worst of fates had come to pass -- that the Elves had somehow thrown in their lot with the forces of the Enemy and so brought the moment of utter defeat and ruin fast upon them -- the Men of Gondor dared not shrink from their foes in the midst of battle, lest all hope of victory be lost in a moment of hesitation.&#10;&#10;Their Captains rallied the men amongst the remnants of the shattered Elf-vanguard and bade them prepare to charge against the Elves, hoping to rout them from the field of battle with the ferocity of their momentum, knowing that prowess and armour would ensure the victory of their immortal foes should the tide of battle turn for even a moment." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 17" itemId="1879052527" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 17"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="The page follows a florid description of the great blaze of trumpets and the snapping of banners in the rapidly clearing morning, as the sun rose higher upon the field, and the regiment sprang into thunderous motion up the hill.&#10;&#10;The captain then describes his own puzzlement as he watched the archers of the Elf-host begin their response, hurling their arrows not at them, but up into the sky, the motion of each archer seeming almost lazy and indifferent to the onrushing army, but each one moving with a strict and rapid precision that belied their careless aim." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 18" itemId="1879052528" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 18"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This page describes a bedlam of frightened men and horses as arrows rained down among them, a seemingly endless hail of shafts biting armour, flesh, and ground alike with callous indifference. The captain relates that it was not the deadly accuracy of the arrows that inspired fear and chaos, but their random intensity, such that no man upon the field might feel safe or protected for even a moment whether he carried shield or stood in the shadow of his fellow, and so many faltered and stopped, laying about in vain for cover where there was none to be found.&#10;&#10;The indifferent rain continued until all was chaos and disorder, and few were those valiant souls who made their way to the Elf-host, there to die upon sword and pike wielded with ruthless efficiency." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 21" itemId="1879052529" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 21"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="The captain's last entry describes matters that followed the battle, after the Elves took him and those few others who survived their injuries upon the field captive, and in a short while untangled the deception of the Enemy, for it had been his purpose that the battle should not be so decisive, or that the Men of the West should emerge victorious over the forces of Lórien and so unravel the nascent Alliance -- but the Elves, having come to little harm in the battle, were thus inclined to be lenient and instead directed their anger even more hotly towards Barad-dûr.&#10;&#10;The captain closes by pondering the irony of his regiment's defeat. Had they acquitted themselves with greater valour and cunning upon the field of battle that day...what then would have befallen the Kingdom of Gondor, or indeed all of Middle-earth in the war that followed? Small comfort for so many friends lost, but such are the whims of fate and war." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 24" itemId="1879052530" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 24"/>

<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This section of the book includes a spirited argument between philosophers over the nature of Oaths and the Fate of those who become bound up in them.&#10;&#10;On one side of the matter are those who argue that the words and intent of the Oathgiver serve to shape fate itself, tying them irrovocably together in a bond that may guide the actions of those who are part of it in their endeavours -- and similarly hanging as a sword over the Oathgiver, promising a dread fate should that bond be violated.&#10;&#10;The other side of the debate includes scholars who reject the notion that mere words shape the world, claiming instead that it is the actions of the Oathgiver that decide the outcome of fate. They argue that the Oath itself simply acts to focus the will or prove the lie of the one who takes it, and that the shame of failure, corruption of the spirit, and the disillusionment of their peers serve more than adequately to turn the tides of fate against the oathbreaker without need of divine providence to mete out punishment." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 8" itemId="1879053054" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 8"/>

The writer attempts to determine whether a creature such as a Dragon could ever truly be bound by an Oath, however granted, or whether they could indeed be bound as such, but would instead use their mastery of lies and deceit to craft an Oath such that the one to whom they granted it would find themselves bound instead.&#10;&#10;The arguments, while interesting, eventually become circular and insubstantial as it becomes clear that the writer had little experience in the subject of speaking with Dragons, yet was wise enough not to seek out experiemental evidence with which to support his work...." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 14" itemId="1879053056" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 14"/>

It states that while all Oaths bind, the strength of that bond and the fate that follows may have little to do with the gravity of the words spoken, and a great deal to do with the unforeseen events that then follow.&#10;&#10;In particular, the scholar points out the story of a simple and friendly Oath offered at the birthday of a minor noble of the houses of Númenor -- an Oath that in the course of time and events drew his house into a years-long war which served to destroy the fortunes of his family and saw him die a lonely pauper.&#10;&#10;Alas, it is impossible to say if the tale was a true one, or a cautionary fable devised by the author to strengthen his argument." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 17" itemId="1879053057" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 17"/>

The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.&#10;&#10;It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past. Perhaps someone in Rivendell will be able to help decipher the book.">

<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="Like several others, this section is written mainly in Elven prose of an ancient form, making it devilishly difficult to comprehend. You manage to make out several passages that refer to the Oaths of service or fealty that the Elf-guardians of old would make to their charges and lords before embarking into danger.&#10;&#10;It seems that they believed such Oaths formed the an important foundation for their strength in battle, and they would never enter into them lightly." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 6" itemId="1879060183" itemName="The Final Word, Page 6"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="Another page of nearly indecipherable and ancient prose, it describes battle between two enemies as something other than a simple melee.&#10;&#10;Instead, the text describes battles between powerful foes as a form of ritual or dance (your translation here is uncertain) -- one that forms the basis for a bond between the two combatants that transcends the physical.&#10;&#10;You begin to suspect that the author was a of a decidedly mystical outlook." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 7" itemId="1879060184" itemName="The Final Word, Page 7"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="Sticking to indescipherable prose, the author speaks of the greater tide of battle, wherein many foes stand across from each other hurling insult and threat before inevitably breaking upon each other. This aspect, too, he considers the foundation of a greater bond, both between the fellow warriors of each army, and between the two forces themselves as they steel themselves for battle.&#10;&#10;You remain unclear on the nature of this bond the author keeps referring to, but it is clearly the central theme of the work." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 13" itemId="1879054881" itemName="The Final Word, Page 13"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This page is one of the few written in plain language, though the ancient tongue makes it difficult nevertheless.&#10;&#10;It speaks of more mundane subjects than some of the others, such as the crucial role of the guardian in maintaining control over the pace of battle, never allowing it to run away from from them and become that portrait of meaningless chaos and noise that presages defeat." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 14" itemId="1879060185" itemName="The Final Word, Page 14"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="Another of the few pages that forego prose for plain language, this speaks to the strength of the guardian's defence, and the manner in which it permits them to find their way to the pulsing heart of the battle, a vantage from which one may express the greatest degree of control over the ebb and flow of the enemy's motion and morale." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 19" itemId="1879060186" itemName="The Final Word, Page 19"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This page is written in prose so flowery and intricate that after the toils of translating the ancient text you are left with no idea what point the author was trying to make.&#10;&#10;Hopefully it is not crucial to the book's secrets or the author would have spoken more plainly?" progressOverride="The Final Word, page 21" itemId="1879060187" itemName="The Final Word, Page 21"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This poem describes that moment in which a great warrior finds himself standing at the heart of the maelstrom -- that place in time and space where the course of the battle almost seems to be suspended like a great thunderhead, moments before the storm breaks. A sense of dread fate falls upon the warrior's shoulders, knowing that the next decision made will resonate with the fate of the world and describe much that is to come." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 24" itemId="1879060188" itemName="The Final Word, Page 24"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="The final page tells of a word -- or perhaps a will made manifest by the heart of the warrior as they stand among their foes and allies alike. Both Oath and Challenge, the form of the word itself is second to its purpose and moment, which the warrior may use to bind all those who face him to his own fate irrevocably.&#10;&#10;The author's point is clear. You find yourself wondering whether he purposes to say that there is truly a spiritual force to this word, or whether it is simply a call to the burning hatred of your enemies that in such a time and place they cannot refuse it." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 27" itemId="1879060189" itemName="The Final Word, Page 27"/>

<objective index="1" text="Find the flowers marking the passing of the eight Entwives within the Old Forest.">
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="You have found the flower of Rhosthon. It is believed that she was once an Entwife who stood with vigilance over her gardens. None could approach without her knowledge, and those with evil intent would feel her gaze upon them and flee.&#10;&#10;She passed into the Old Forest many long years ago and became part of the forest, granting her keen senses to the trees and creatures herein that evil might not approach unseen, for those were dark days and few places remained that were untouched by the power of Sauron.&#10;&#10;The flowers are said to mark the place where she disappeared into the forest and seem to have been tended by someone." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879071999" itemName="Rhosthon's Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="You have discovered the flower of Neldorlas, an Entwife of old. It was she who was formost in the arts of nurturing the young, that they might achieve their potential in the fulness of time.&#10;&#10;Not one seed did she plant, nor youthful mind touch that did not come to fruition, unless it was struck down by unfortunate fate. Such was her understanding of the arts of cultivation and teaching.&#10;&#10;As with her sisters, she chose to become a part of the Old Forest, that it might endure the encroachment of darkness and evil throughout the years. So the folk tales say, anyway." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072000" itemName="Neldorlas' Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="The flower you found marks the place where the Entwife Dorollin passed into the Old Forest, perhaps forever.&#10;&#10;She was among the largest of her kind, taller than any other, for the essence of all that grows was at the core of her nature. Her gardens were sprawling places wrapped in great vines, and enormous trees cast their shade upon acres of fertile ground.&#10;&#10;She gave herself to the Old Forest to ensure that it would grow great enough to protect itself from the incursion of evil such as Orcs and thoughtless Men.&#10;&#10;Some folk say that one day they will awaken and emerge from the forest - but no one knows when that might be." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072001" itemName="Dorollin's Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="You discovered Cordofoneth's flower - said to be one of eight Entwife sisters. Among her kin, she held most dear her affection for all living things.&#10;&#10;It was this affection that she lent the Old Forest when she passed into its depths long ago, that all manner of living things might find shelter within its bounds. The flower you have found marks the place where she entered the the forest, and she has not been seen since.&#10;&#10;Alas, the Old Forest has oft been harmed by Men or intruded upon by darker powers, and so it is said that her heart lies muted, and she sleeps more deeply than her sisters. Perhaps she is awaiting the day when this world might become a place of lighter moods and the love of life is not so easily betrayed by axe or fire." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072002" itemName="Cordofoneth's Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="You have discoverd the flower of Lenhwest. She was believed to be an Entwife known for her unquenchable passions. She could love as no other, but fury and despair were also her constant companions.&#10;&#10;Amongst her sisters, she was the first to give herself to the forest, swept by her own emotions to ensure its survival during the trials of those dark years. Her presense is strongly felt in these woods still.&#10;&#10;It is for fear of Lenhwest's tempestuous anger that folk walk with care in the Old Forest, for many believe that if her heart turns against you, it is unlikely you will ever emerge from it again!" showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072003" itemName="Lenhwest's Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="You have found Silloth's flower. She was said to have been a wonderous spirit - her heart was unbowed even during the ancient war that drove the Entwife sisters here, for mirth and frivolity ever followed in her wake, and her gardens were believed to be places where even the weariest of mortals could bring themselves to smile and laugh.&#10;&#10;Among the elves she was particularly beloved, and of those who remember her they fear they may never again hear the sound of her laughter beneath the boughs of ancient trees." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072004" itemName="Silloth's Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="The flower of Braiglad is seen as a warning by superstitious folk who would dare the depths of the Old Forest. She was an Entwife unusual amongst her sisters, for she was a wild and capricious being. Her gardens were populated by untamed beasts, and even the most delicate flowers within them were adorned with sharp thorns.&#10;&#10;Braiglad rarely spoke with mortals, preferring the wild places of the forest, and in time she gave herself to the forest to protect it from the dark powers.&#10;&#10;There are those who say her spirit is strongest when aroused by wild and dangerous times such as these." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072005" itemName="Braiglad's Flower"/>
<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="The tale of Merillif's flower often brings tears to those who hear it. Of the eight Entwives who came to the Old Forest, she was the most beautiful and the most beloved of all.&#10;&#10;Her gardens shone with a brilliance of colour that even the finest artisans of the Firstborn would regard with envy. Her jewels were said to be the petals of flowers, and while they would last but a short season -- unlike the gems of the Noldor which are forever -- their beauty far surpassed that of any object carved of stone or crystal. This passing beauty was such that it endured no greed, and so the vanity of evil hearts could neither possess nor endure it.&#10;&#10;Those who are fond of the story say that she will awaken some day when beauty can again be shared amongst all the creatures of Arda without fear of despoilment or jealous vanity." showBillboardText="false" itemId="1879072006" itemName="Merillif's Flower"/>

How they came to be this way is a mystery -- perhaps by the fall of an entire peak upon the mountainside below or some equally cataclysmic event.&#10;&#10;The caves are oddly warmer than the wind-stripped slopes outside, possibly heated by a warm spring welling up from deep below the mountain. However, any traveller hoping to take shelter within would be strongly advised to look elsewhere, for this same warmth has drawn a large and deadly brood of worms into these caves, and to carelessly wander within is certain death." showBillboardText="false" landmarkId="1879097619" landmarkName="Writhenbores"/>

In time, tired of being tormented by their diminutive foes, the giants left this place and moved towards Iorbar to the south-west.&#10;&#10;Only the massive stone slabs that they once used as shelter remain, echoing with the howls of the Wargs who now prowl among them." showBillboardText="false" landmarkId="1879097629" landmarkName="Starkhath"/>
